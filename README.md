# assemblystructures - a collection of common data structures & algorithms written in C/C++/Rust

## these structures will first be written in C.
If it is possible, I later plan to create them in C++ and Rust.

I plan to follow the following lecture's content:
* https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~uehara/course/2018/myanmar/
* Introduction to Algorithms, CLRS
* https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-spring-2008/

## table of contents
0. conditionals & loops (basics)
0. taking in input (argv, stdin, FILE*, streams, mmap)
1. insertion sort (page 39)
